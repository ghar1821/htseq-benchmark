Folders are organised based on the various benchmarking type in Supplementary Figure 1:

1. Supplementary Figure 1A: 8_cells
2. Supplementary Figure 1B: 200_cells
3. Supplementary Figure 1C: pbmc1k

Scripts that are applicable across multiple figures, i.e. to download FASTQs or generate star genome are placed in the main directory of the repository.
